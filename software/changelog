- Support for Protocol 2.0

2.0.1:
- Fix buffer overflow in WIFI Extension code

2.0.2:
- Fixes for a more stable WIFI Extension:
  - Remove command/data mode, use only one place for receiving/sending: allows
    for much better error handling, debugging and logging
  - Only save messages in brickd if return expected
  - Parse all command responses with human readable response
  - Parse <ESC>O, <ESC>F, <ESC>A options more thoroughly
  - Remove messages from brickd if socket disconnected
  - Make WIFI initialization asynchronous: allows to communicate with Master
    Brick while WIFI is connecting
  - Use 5 minute timeout before we assume a hang up (instead of 3)
  - Evaluate received data while sending command
  - Use different ATS configuration
  - Parse startup/reset message
  - Refactor data state machine

2.0.3:
- Use smaller USB timeout on startup enumeration to allow faster enumeration
- Dont reread the config after the first WIFI association fails

2.0.4:
- Reset WIFI module after disassociate from access point
- Fix problem with changing of slave addresses of Chibi and RS485 Extension
- Externalize WIFI ringbuffer and feed bytes in state machine byte by byte
  (will allow the use of DMA controller later on)

2.0.5:
- Reissue Low-Power-Mode after disassociate
- Add API for:
  - SetWifiHostname
  - GetWifiHostname
  - SetCurrentCallbackPeriod
  - GetCurrentCallbackPeriod
  - SetVoltageCallbackPeriod
  - GetVoltageCallbackPeriod
  - SetUSBVoltageCallbackPeriod
  - GetUSBVoltageCallbackPeriod
  - SetCurrentCallbackThreshold
  - GetCurrentCallbackThreshold
  - SetVoltageCallbackThreshold
  - GetVoltageCallbackThreshold
  - SetUSBVoltageCallbackThreshold
  - GetUSBVoltageCallbackThreshold
  - SetDebouncePeriod
  - GetDebouncePeriod
  - Current (Callback)
  - Voltage (Callback)
  - USBVoltage (Callback)
  - CurrentReached (Callback)
  - VoltageReached (Callback)
