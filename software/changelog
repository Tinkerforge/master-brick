1.0.0: Initial version
1.1.0: Add support for tick types
1.1.1: Fix bug with timeouts on windows (through bricklib)
1.1.2: Add USB request detection to allow Chibi slave stack to be powered over USB
1.1.3: Fix bug with ADC calibration readout (through bricklib)
1.1.4: Use new heuristic for Chibi slave detection (master address == address)
1.1.5: Disable IRQs in SPI Master communication, otherwise Stepper Brick doesn't work over Chibi (through bricklib)
1.1.6: Fix several Chibi bugs:
 - sanity check on Chibi participants discovery
 - if no ack: slave recvs, master sends
 - no rx_aack_on state if Chibi recv buffer not empty
1.1.7: Fix several Chibi bugs:
 - check sequence number to eliminate duplicates
 - different negotiation of send and recv states (now more messages from master to slave possible should be possible)
1.2.0: Add RS485 support
1.2.1: Add get_temperature and reset function
1.2.2: Add USB hotplug support (through bricklib)
1.2.3: Use dynamically calculated timeouts for RS485, improve Bricklet readout
1.2.4: Send empty message if slave has timeout, to allow slave to process buffer
1.3.0: Add WIFI Extension support
1.3.1: Remove unnecessary check (more bandwidth for WIFI Extension)
1.3.2: Add receive ringbuffer (prevent overflow due to callbacks)
1.3.3: Add support for Ad Hoc and Access Point mode
1.3.4: Add API for setting of WIFI regulatory domain
