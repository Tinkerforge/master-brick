1.1.6: Fix several Chibi bugs:
 - sanity check on Chibi participants discovery
 - if no ack: slave recvs, master sends
 - no rx_aack_on state if Chibi recv buffer not empty
1.1.7: Fix several Chibi bugs:
 - check sequence number to eliminate duplicates
 - different negotiation of send and recv states (now more messages from master to slave possible should be possible)

1.2.1: Add get_chip_temperature and reset function
1.2.2: Add USB hotplug support (through bricklib)
1.2.3: Use dynamically calculated timeouts for RS485, improve Bricklet readout
1.2.4: Send empty message if slave has timeout, to allow slave to process buffer
1.3.0: Add WIFI Extension support
1.3.1: Remove unnecessary check (more bandwidth for WIFI Extension)
1.3.2: Add receive ringbuffer (prevent overflow due to callbacks)
1.3.3: Add support for Ad Hoc and Access Point mode
1.3.4: Add API for setting of WIFI regulatory domain
1.3.5: Add GetUSBVoltage API, add autorestart after 3min without answer from GS1011, add support for "," in passphrase
1.3.6: Use WSEC=1 instead of auth mode = open for no encryption
1.4.0: Fix reset when multiple masters in a stack are used, add support for Master Brick 2.0
1.4.1: Fix bug in RS485 code (rs485 recv pin was set by wifi code)
1.4.2: Add support for usage of two extensions at the same time
1.4.3: Fix mixup between Ad Hoc DHCP and AP Static IP
1.4.4: Fix Chibi Extension initialization sequence
1.4.5: Fix Problem with RS485 + WIFI + Step Down PS combination
1.4.6: Change Bricklet Context size from 250 to 256 (through bricklib)
2.0.0: Support for protocol 2.0
2.0.1: Fix buffer overflow in WIFI Extension code
2.0.2: Fixes for a more stable WIFI Extension
 - Remove command/data mode, use only one place for receiving/sending
  - Allows for much better error handling, debugging and logging
 - Only save messages in brickd if return expected
 - Parse all command responses with human readable response
 - Parse <ESC>O, <ESC>F, <ESC>A options more thoroughly
 - Remove messages from brickd if socket disconnected
 - Make WIFI initialization asynchronous
  - Allows to communicate with Master Brick while WIFI is connecting
 - Use 5 minute timeout before we assume a hang up (instead of 3)
 - Evaluate received data while sending command
 - Use different ATS configuration
 - Parse startup/reset message
 - Refactor data state machine
2.0.3: Use smaller USB timeout on startup enumeration, to allow faster enumeration
 - Dont reread the config after the first WIFI association fails
2.0.4: Reset WIFI Module after disassociate from AP
 - Fix problem with changing of slave addresses of Chibi and RS485 Extension
 - Externalize WIFI ringbuffer and feed bytes in state machine byte by byte (will allow the use of DMA controller later on)
2.0.5: Reissue Low-Power-Mode after disassociate and add API for:
 - SetWifiHostname
 - GetWifiHostname
 - SetCurrentCallbackPeriod
 - GetCurrentCallbackPeriod
 - SetVoltageCallbackPeriod
 - GetVoltageCallbackPeriod
 - SetUSBVoltageCallbackPeriod
 - GetUSBVoltageCallbackPeriod
 - SetCurrentCallbackThreshold
 - GetCurrentCallbackThreshold
 - SetVoltageCallbackThreshold
 - GetVoltageCallbackThreshold
 - SetUSBVoltageCallbackThreshold
 - GetUSBVoltageCallbackThreshold
 - SetDebouncePeriod
 - GetDebouncePeriod
 - Current (Callback)
 - Voltage (Callback)
 - USBVoltage (Callback)
 - CurrentReached (Callback)
 - VoltageReached (Callback)
 - USBVoltageReached (Callback)
2.0.6: Add forced ACK after 10ms without answer
 - Handle WIFI xon/xoff commands of GS1011MEES
 - Add watchdog timer (restart after 16s of "deadlock")
2.1.0: Add support for Ethernet Extension
2.1.1: Increase ethernet reset holding time from 2us to 10us to ensure proper bootup
2.1.2: Call ethernet reset function 2 times to make sure it works always
2.2.0: Add support for Websockets for Ethernet Extension
 - Add support for authentication of Ethernet/WIFI Extension
 - Reset on USB Resume, to get a clean state
 - Increase USB hotplug detect threshold
 - SPI stack slave gives up immediately if message length too long
2.2.1: Remove "Suspend to Disk fix", seems to make problems on some windows versions (through bricklib)
2.2.2: Remove USB hotplug support (through bricklib)
2.3.0: Add support for new SPI protocol
 - Add support for Master Brick 2.1
